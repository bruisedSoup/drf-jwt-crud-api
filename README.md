Django XML CRUD API
This project is a Django-based CRUD web service integrated with a MySQL database, designed to manage library book records through XML-based HTTP API endpoints.

Project Requirements
The application meets the following functional and technical requirements:

Framework: The project is built using the Django web framework (version 5.0.4) with no Django REST Framework used — only built-in Django tools and Python's standard xml.etree.ElementTree library.

Database Configuration: The Django project is configured to use MySQL as the backend database (library_db), with proper connection settings defined in settings.py including host, port, charset, and strict mode.

Application & Model: A Django application (books) has been created containing a model (Book) that defines a database table with the following fields: title, author, year, genre, isbn, created_at, and updated_at — satisfying the minimum requirement of three fields.

Migrations: Database migrations have been performed using python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate, successfully creating the books table in MySQL.

XML Request Handling: All client requests must be sent in XML format. The server parses incoming XML using ET.fromstring() and extracts field values from XML tags.

XML Response Handling: All server responses are returned strictly in valid XML format. JSON responses are not used anywhere in the project. Responses are built using ET.Element and ET.tostring() and returned as HttpResponse with content_type='application/xml'.

Complete CRUD Functionality:

Create (POST /api/books/): Accepts XML body and inserts a new book record into MySQL.
Retrieve All (GET /api/books/): Returns all book records as XML.
Retrieve One (GET /api/books/<id>/): Returns a single book record by ID as XML.
Update (PUT /api/books/<id>/): Accepts XML body and updates an existing book record in MySQL.
Delete (DELETE /api/books/<id>/): Removes a book record from MySQL and returns XML confirmation.
Search (GET /api/books/search/?q=keyword): Searches books by title or author and returns XML results.
Error Handling: Proper XML-based error responses are returned for all failure cases including missing required fields (400), book not found (404), duplicate ISBN (409), and invalid method (405).

API Testing: All endpoints have been tested using Postman, including create, retrieve, update, delete, and error handling scenarios.

URL Routing: Routing is configured in both library_project/urls.py and books/urls.py to ensure all endpoints function correctly under the /api/ prefix.

Admin Verification: Records can be viewed and managed through the Django Administration panel at /admin after creating a superuser.

MySQL Verification: Data stored in MySQL is verified using the MySQL command-line client with SELECT * FROM books;.

Functional Validation
The completed project clearly validates all CRUD operations through XML-based HTTP API endpoints:

Create: Send POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/ with XML body to insert a book record.
Read All: Send GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/ to retrieve all books as XML.
Read One: Send GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1/ to retrieve a specific book as XML.
Update: Send PUT http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1/ with XML body to update a book record.
Delete: Send DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/1/ to remove a book record.
Error Handling: Send invalid requests to verify proper XML error responses are returned.
Admin Verification: Records can also be managed through the Django Administration panel at /admin.
MySQL Verification: Run SELECT * FROM books; in MySQL CLI to confirm data is persisted.
Tech Stack
Backend: Django 5.0.4 (Python 3.11+)

How to Clone and Run (School Lab Setup)
Follow these steps exactly if you are setting up this project on a new machine such as a school laboratory computer.

Prerequisites — install these first if not already installed
Python 3.11 or 3.12 → https://www.python.org/downloads/
MySQL 8.0 → https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
Git → https://git-scm.com/downloads
Step 1 — Open Command Prompt
Press Win + R → type cmd → press Enter.

Step 2 — Clone the repository
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/library-xml-crud.git
cd library-xml-crud
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with the actual GitHub username.

Step 3 — Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Your prompt should now start with (venv).

Step 4 — Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
If mysqlclient fails to install, run this instead:

pip install PyMySQL
Then open library_project/__init__.py and add:

import pymysql
pymysql.install_as_MySQLdb()
Step 5 — Create the MySQL database
Open MySQL Command Line Client from the Start Menu, enter your root password, then run:

CREATE DATABASE library_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
EXIT;
Step 6 — Update the database password in settings.py
Open library_project/settings.py and update the PASSWORD field to match the MySQL root password on this machine:

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'library_db',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_mysql_password_here',   # ← change this
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
Step 7 — Run migrations
python manage.py migrate
You should see Applying books.0001_initial... OK in the output.

Step 8 — Create admin superuser (optional)
python manage.py createsuperuser
Enter username admin and password admin1234.

Step 9 — Start the server
python manage.py runserver
Step 10 — Test the API
Open Postman and test the endpoints listed in the API Endpoints table above.

The server runs at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

Example first request — GET all books:

GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/
Example create request — POST with XML body:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<book>
  <title>Clean Code</title>
  <author>Robert C. Martin</author>
  <year>2008</year>
  <genre>Technology</genre>
</book>
